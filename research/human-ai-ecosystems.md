## Human–AI Ecosystems & SheLL

Instead of treating models as isolated tools, we view AI as part of a larger ecosystem of humans and agents that learn from each other over time.

In this vertical, we explore:

- **SheLL (Shared Experience Lifelong Learning)** – frameworks for sharing knowledge and experience across institutions, agents, and tasks.
- **Multi-agent collaboration** – how AI systems and humans can coordinate, specialize, and exchange information.
- **Autonomous research assistants** – algorithmic foundations for agents that can help design studies, run experiments, and iterate on ideas.

These projects aim to move from single-model training toward continuous, collective intelligence that accelerates scientific discovery.
