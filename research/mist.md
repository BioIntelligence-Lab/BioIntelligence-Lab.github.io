## MIST: Medical Image Streaming Toolkit

MIST is a format-agnostic, open-source framework for streaming medical images at different resolutions and formats from a single high-resolution copy.

It enables:

- Progressive, multi-resolution streaming using HTJ2K.
- Bandwidth and storage savings for large public datasets.
- AI-aware streaming for efficient training and inference.
- A clean Python interface that integrates with existing research workflows.

For more details, see the dedicated MIST project page and GitHub repository.
