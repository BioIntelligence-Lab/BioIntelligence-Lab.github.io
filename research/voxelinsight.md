## VoxelInsight

VoxelInsight is a conversational assistant for medical imaging research.

It aims to:

- Connect image processing tools (segmentation, radiomics, registration) behind a natural language interface.
- Automate common research workflows, from dataset preparation to model evaluation.
- Serve as a foundation for future autonomous research agents built on the SheLL ecosystem.

A public-facing version will be released once the platform is stabilized; for now, it is actively evolving within the lab.
