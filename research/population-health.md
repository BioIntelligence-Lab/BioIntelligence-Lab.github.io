## Population Health Imaging

We leverage large-scale, clinically acquired imaging datasets to study health at the population level.

Our interests include:

- **Opportunistic screening** – extracting hidden risk signals (e.g., future dementia or cardiometabolic risk) from scans obtained for other reasons.
- **Disparities and access** – understanding how imaging findings and AI models interact with sociodemographic factors.
- **Longitudinal cohorts** – linking imaging, clinical data, and outcomes to uncover trajectories of health and disease across populations.

This work complements our disease modeling efforts by asking questions at the scale of cohorts and health systems.
