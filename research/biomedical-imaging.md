## Biomedical Imaging Research

We use imaging to uncover hidden patterns in disease and population health.

Our work spans:

- **Computational disease modeling** – characterizing tumors and organs with rich quantitative signatures, tracking how they evolve over time, and linking them to outcomes.
- **Population health imaging** – using clinically acquired scans at scale to study risk, disparities, and opportunistic screening.

Examples include tumor connectomics, longitudinal modeling of treatment response, and imaging biomarkers that connect anatomy, physiology, and cognition.
