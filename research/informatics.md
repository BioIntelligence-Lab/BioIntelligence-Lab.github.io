## Informatics & Tools

To enable both foundational AI and biomedical discovery, we build practical software systems that make large-scale imaging research possible.

Two flagship platforms anchor this vertical:

- **MIST (Medical Image Streaming Toolkit)** – a format-agnostic framework for progressive, bandwidth-efficient streaming of large imaging datasets.
- **VoxelInsight** – a conversational imaging assistant that orchestrates segmentation, radiomics, and analysis workflows via natural language.

These tools are designed as catalysts: they lower friction for experimentation, enable multi-center collaboration, and create new opportunities for automated discovery.
