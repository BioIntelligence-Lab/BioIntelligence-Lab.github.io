  <h1>Fundamental AI Research</h1>
  <p>
    Advancing the foundations of Artificial Intelligence through safety, trustworthiness, human–AI ecosystems, and
    multi-agent autonomy — exploring how intelligent systems learn, collaborate, and evolve over time.

<!-- AI SAFETY -->
<h2 class="section-title">AI Safety & Trustworthiness</h2>

<div class="content-block">
  <p>
    We develop methods to ensure AI systems are reliable, transparent, and equitable — addressing bias, uncertainty,
    robustness to real-world clinical variation, security vulnerabilities, demographic leakage, and safe use of
    generative AI in radiology and beyond.
  </p>

<!-- HUMAN-AI ECOSYSTEM -->
<h2 class="section-title">Human–AI Ecosystem</h2>

<div class="content-block">
  <p>
    We investigate how AI systems can collaborate with each other and with humans — learning across sites, agents,
    and tasks. This includes the development of SheLL (Shared Experience Lifelong Learning), multi-agent reasoning,
    and foundations for autonomous research workflows.
